                            I'm a dedicated and passionate web developer with a knack for creating responsive and
                            user-friendly
                            applications. My expertise lies in crafting seamless user experiences using React, CSS, and
                            modern
                            web development tools. With a deep understanding of both design and functionality, I ensure
                            every
                            project not only works flawlessly but also looks stunning.
                        </p>
                        <p>


                            When I'm not coding, I dedicate my time to training both kids and adults in tech skills,
                            inspiring
                            the next generation of innovators. As the sole instructor in my department, I take pride in
                            nurturing talent and fostering a love for technology.
                        </p>

                            Over the years, Iâ€™ve built and enhanced projects for various industries, including finance,
                            fashion,
                            and education. I thrive on problem-solving, constantly seeking innovative solutions and
                            paying
                            close
                            attention to detail. From creating interactive components like modals and dropdowns to
                            integrating
                            dynamic features such as language switching and payment workflows, I strive to deliver
                            excellence in
                            every line of code.
